# Places to spend Litecoin on the Lightning Network

1. [Bitrefill](https://en.bitrefill.com/usa/) Prepaid phone minutes, steam vouchers, and reddit gold.
2. [LTCShop](https://ltcshop.roska.life/) A store that sells stickers!
3. [Million Litecoin Homepage](https://millionlitecoinhomepage.net/) Place to draw pictures by buying pixels.  You can override a pixel for the same price of the last purchase, so it will always cost 1 litoshi / pixel except if someone wants to pay more (from 10 litoshis to 1 ltc) to draw pixels.  This disincentivizes people not to draw over your pixels. 
4. [Litoshisplace.com](https://litoshisplace.com/) Similar to satoshis.place where you can draw by buying pixels.  Unlike Million Litecoin Homepage, there is no upcharge to make it more expensive to replace a pixel.  
5. [quinsolo.com](https://quinsolo.com/) Litecoin and other cryptocurrency themed vinyls, coasters, and magnets.
